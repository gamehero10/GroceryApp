# GroceryApp
This will be a grocery app. It will let users make a grocery list. New features will be added to this app in order to enhance it. It will also include an optimized function and error handling. The grocery app now has persistent storage. That is the first feature. Users can now save their grocery list items even after refreshing or closing the browser. A second feature has been added to the app. Users can now click on an item and update its name. Additionally, there is an edit button next to each item. A third feature has been added to the app. Each grocery item now includes a checkbox. When checked, the item is now marked as bought. The text appears with a strikethrough and a different color. The bought status will be saved in local storage to persist across page reloads. A fourth and final feature has been added to the application. Grocery store items are now separated into different categories.
